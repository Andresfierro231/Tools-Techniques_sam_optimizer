## **SAM Optimizer for Molten-Salt Loop Modeling**

**Author:** Andrés Nicolás Fierro López
**Course:** Computational Engineering Project
**Toolchain:** SAM (System Analysis Module), MOOSE Framework, Python (workflow automation), HPC resources (TACC LS6)

---

## **1. Project Overview**

This project develops an automated **SAM optimization pipeline** to calibrate, validate, and accelerate thermal-hydraulic simulations of a molten-salt natural-circulation loop (e.g., TAMU MSFL). The objective is to build a reproducible workflow that:

1. Establishes a **performance baseline** for SAM simulations across solver configurations, mesh sizes, time-step selections, and nonlinear/linear solver tolerances.
2. Automates **parameter sweeps, run management, runtime tracking**, and postprocessing.
3. Implements a **lightweight ML-guided optimization** layer for early-exit heuristics and parameter tuning to reduce runtime while preserving accuracy.
4. Compares SAM model outputs against **experimental validation data** and prior benchmark cases.

The project serves as a foundation for a future **digital-twin pipeline** that couples SAM simulations with surrogate models (e.g., Random Forests, GBDTs, Optuna-style search heuristics).

## **3. Computational Workflow**

### **3.1 Parameterized SAM Input Generation**

Base `.i` templates are dynamically modified to sweep over:

* mesh density (`node_multiplier`)
* solver order (1st / 2nd order)
* initial/boundary conditions (inlet temperature, heater power, mass-flow initialization)
* time-step control parameters
* nonlinear and linear solver tolerances

All modifications are logged for reproducibility.

---

### **3.2 Simulation Execution & Runtime Tracking**

Simulations are launched via Python’s `subprocess` interface:

* Start/stop timestamps recorded with `time.perf_counter()`
* Solver metadata captured from SAM logs:

  * nonlinear iterations
  * linear iterations
  * Jacobian evaluations
  * timestep count
  * convergence failures
  * CFL & stability metrics

A master record (`runtimes_master.csv`) aggregates all studies.

---

### **3.3 Postprocessing & Accuracy Metrics**

Outputs are parsed and compared against:

* **Validation data** (experimental loop ∆T, TP1–TP6 temperature profiles, pressure drops)
* **Prior SAM runs** (baseline coarse/fine mesh results)

Computed metrics include:

* RMSE between model and experiment
* % error of ∆T across measurement points
* Runtime vs accuracy tradeoff curves
* Mesh order and discretization effects
* Solver stability behaviors

Visualization includes:

* Runtime scaling laws
* Accuracy vs node_multiplier
* Heat-transfer coefficient sensitivity
* Pareto-optimal parameter sets

---

### **3.4 ML-Guided Optimization (Prototype)**

A lightweight ML layer analyzes:

* relationships between runtime and solver configuration
* patterns indicating “slow” runs early in execution
* predictive features for early-exit heuristics

Models tested:

* Random Forest Regressor (runtime prediction)
* Gradient Boosted Trees (feature ranking)
* Logistic Classification (predict “will exceed runtime budget?”)

This enables adaptive stopping rules and smarter parameter exploration.

---

## **4. Results Summary**

**Key findings from the runtime and accuracy analyses:**

* Higher-order time discretization improves accuracy with only moderate runtime penalty for mid-range mesh densities.
* Runtime scales nearly linearly with `node_multiplier`, with sharp increases beyond ×16.
* Heat-transfer correlations significantly affect stability and accuracy; geometry-specific correlations produce the best results.
* ML-based early-quit heuristics reduce wasted computation on unstable or overly expensive runs.
* The full pipeline supports rapid, repeatable studies for future SAM-based digital-twin development.
